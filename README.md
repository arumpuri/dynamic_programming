Samantha and Sam are playing a numbers game. Given a number as a string, no leading zeros, determine the sum of all integer values of substrings of the string.

Given an integer as a string, sum all of its substrings cast as integers. As the number may become large, return the value modulo .

Example

The substrings of 123 are 1, 2, 3, 12, 23, 123 which sum to 164.
