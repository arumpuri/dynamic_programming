(sam and substring)

Samantha and Sam are playing a numbers game. Given a number as a string, no leading zeros, determine the sum of all integer values of substrings of the string.

Given an integer as a string, sum all of its substrings cast as integers. As the number may become large, return the value modulo.

Example

The substrings of 123 are 1, 2, 3, 12, 23, and 123 which sum to 164.

(Fibonacci Modified)
Given three integers,t1,t2, and n compute and print the n-th term of a modified Fibonacci sequence.
t1 = 0
t2 = 1
n = 5
t3 = 0 + 1**2
t4 = 1 + 1**2
t5 = 1 + 2 **2

t(i+2) = t(i) + t(i+1)**2
